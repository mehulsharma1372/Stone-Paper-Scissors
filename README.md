# Stone-Paper-Scissors
Get your childhood back.
This is a game we all used to play in our childhood. I have tried to bring the memories back with the help of python. Some might call it Snake water gun and so on.
In this scissors will cut the paper, paper will wrap the stone and stone will break the scissors. 
It is made by using Random module and nested loops.
